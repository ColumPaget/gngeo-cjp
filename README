gngeo-cjp: This is Colum Paget's fork of gngeo 0.8. Most of the function 
keys work again, and a segfault that occurs when loading a saved game has 
been fixed (along with some others). You can now specify a path to a config
file on the command-line. The default font has been make proportional to
maximise screen real estate, and the user can now specify messages that
appear on the screen (the aim of this is to put a summary of moves onscreen
though there's only room for a few. You can also have date/time and hostname
through the use of % format strings. Default rompath and biospath can now be 
set at compile time. Joystick input can be disabled (this wasn't working and
on laptops the touchpad is often detected as a joystick, causing all kinds of 
problems).

Gngeo offers a choice of emulator cores for the z80 and m68000 microprocessors.
Unfortunately not all of these compile any more. On my systems the only z80
core that compiles is 'raze' and only 'starscream' and 'genm68k' work for 
the m68000. So select these at compile time like so:

 ./configure  --with-m68kcore=starscream --with-z80core=raze

GNGEO : A NeoGeo emulator for linux (and maybe some other unix)

Licence:
	Gngeo is built around many different block with various licence.
	The original code is released under the GPLV2 with this special exeption:
	
		As a special exception, You have
		the permission to link the code of this program with
		independent modules,regardless of the license terms of these
		independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
		executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also
		meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions
		of the license of that module. An independent module is a module
		which is not derived from or based on Gngeo. If you modify
		this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the
		library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish
		to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

	Gngeo could not exist without the Mame project, and some code come
	directly from it (the ym2610 for example). As you may know, the Mame
	licence forbid commercial use, and as a consequence, commercial use
	of gngeo (as a whole) is also forbiden. This is the same with Cyclone,
	Drz80, Raze and Starscream.	  

REQUIREMENT : 
	SDL-1.2.x and the libz
	optional: nasm 0.98 for i386 asm optimisation
	You will also need a neogeo BIOS

INSTALLATION :
	./configure && make
	then 'make install' as root 

	The configure script will detect the presence of nasm, and
	choose the different CPU core in consequence. You can force
	the use of one cpu core with the following configure switch:
	 --with-m68kcore=[cyclone|starscream|gen68k]
	 --with-z80core=[drz80|raze|mamez80]
    
    cyclone is written in arm assembler (default on arm target)
    starscream is written in x86 assembler (default on x86 target if nasm is found)
    gen68k is written in portable C (default in every other case)
    
    drz80 is written in arm assembler (default on arm target)
    raze is written in x86 assembler (default on x86 target if nasm is found)
    mamez80 is written in portable C  (default in every other case)

	To disable completly i386 assembler on x86
	 --disable-i386

CROSSCOMPILATION :
	To build gngeo in a crosscompilation environement, use the folowing
	./configure --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=[HOST] --with-sdl-prefix=[Path to your corsscompiled SDL] CFLAGS=-I[PATH to the default include dir of your crosscompil env]

USAGE :
	You can start a game with the folowing command:
	# gngeo game
	where game is the mame name of the rom, for example mslug for Metal Slug

Usage: gngeo [OPTION]... ROMSET

CONFIGURATION :
	All configuration can be done in $HOME/.gngeo/gngeorc
	a sample file is provide : sample_gngeorc
	Every option are also accessible on the command line.
	Per game configuration is also possible in $HOME/.gngeo/game.rc
	
	By default, gngeo search bios and games in
	$prefix/share/gngeo/ (the game must be in a zip file, the bios not)

SCREEN MESSAGES:
the msg1, msg2 and msg3 options allow the specification of up to three messages
to be displayed on the screen. This has the format:

x-pos:y-pos:msg

where x-pos and y-pos are numeric x and y positions for the message. Negative values
of x-pos and y-pos will result in the message being positioned relative to the maximum
x or y position (so back from the right edge or up from the bottom).

msg is the message itself. This can contain the string '\n' to represent a newline, or
format strings in the form:

%h - hostname
%g - game/rom name
%s - system type of rom
%c - country/region for rom
%H - hour
%M - minute
%S - seconds
%d - day
%m - month
%y - 2-digit year
%Y- 4-digit year

messages can also be broken up into 'submessages', by being seperated with the 
pipe character '|'. These sub-messages can then be cycled through using the F7
key.

This feature is intended to allow a 'crib' of moves to be displayed onscreen, esp. for
fighting games that tend to have a lot of 'hcf-a,d,d,d' special moves. As fighting
games have multiple characters, one can define submessages and cycle through to the
messages appropriate for a given character. So, for instance the line below 

Msg1=JURI gb:<-B ls:f,fd,d+ABC rs:d,fd,f+ABC sk:d,db,b+ABC|ROOMI sp:j,d+C rb:d,fd,f+ABC rc:b,f+ABC rB:j+ABC|GUNTER: BS:C gb:f,d,df+ABC ws:360+ABC hb:360+A+B+C|%g-%s-%c %H:%M:%S|

Contains some moves for three characters from 'Galaxy Fight' and a status display as the last selection


GAME-SPECIFIC CONFIG FILES

If no config-file is specified on the command-line, but a game/rom name is, then
an attempt will be name to load a config file <romname>.conf from the config
directory. If this fails the default gngeorc file will be loaded instead.
