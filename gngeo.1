.SH NAME
gngeo \- emulate a SNK Neo-Geo game system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gngeo
.RI [ options ]
.RI ROMSET
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBgngeo\fP is a program that emulates the SNK Neo-Geo game system.
It uses SDL and optimized assembly CPU emulation cores on i386 platforms.
.SH OPERATION
A Neo-Geo BIOS image set is required to play commercially-released games.
Unfortunately, the BIOS images are copyrighted and may not be distributed
with gngeo.
.PP
Like MAME, the memory layout of each game is defined by a driver, which
is simply a plain text description of the game's characteristics needed
by the emulator.  The driver database is installed in /usr/local/share/gngeo/romrc.
If a new program is wanted to be run in gngeo, it must be added to that
database.
.PP
The simplest form of operation is the following:
.br
$ gngeo <game>
.br
where <game> is the MAME name of a Neo-Geo ROM set corresponding to a game.
.br
Examples: \fImslug\fP, \fIgarou\fP, \fIkof99\fP
.PP
You can also use the folowing form of operation:
.br
$ gngeo <file>
.br
where <file> point to a zip that contain the Neo-Geo ROM set.
.PP
However, it is more likely that you will need some of the following command line
options in order to properly locate your ROM collection and Neo-Geo BIOS images.
.PP
By default, gngeo looks for the BIOS images and ROM collection in /usr/share/gngeo.
This can be changed with the \fB-i\fP or \fB--rompath\fP option.  For example:
.br
$ gngeo -i /home/flurbly/neogeo/roms mslug2

.PP
The ROM location, as well as any other options, can be persistently set in the
$HOME/.gngeo/gngeorc.  A sample gngeorc can be found in /usr/share/doc/gngeo;
copy it into your .gngeo directory and adapt it to your needs. Per-game config files can be created, named <game name>.conf, and these are also searched for in the .gngeo directory.
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
.PP
All boolean options can be disabled with --no-OPTION
(Ex: --no-sound turns sound off)
.PP
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-listgame
.br
List all games that gngeo has recognized and are available to play.
.TP
.B \-\-autoframeskip
.br
Enable auto frameskipping.  The program will determine the best frameskip value
to avoid lagging the gameplay on a machine that is too slow to emulate at full
speed.
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-blitter=STRING
.br
Use the specified blitter. \fB-b help\fP will provide a list of available
blitters.  \fBsoft\fP, \fBopengl\fP, and \fByuv\fP are typical choices.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-config=PATH
.br
Path to config file
.TP
.B \-\-country=STRING
.br
Set the country code to \fBjapan\fP, \fBusa\fP, or \fBeurope\fP.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-debug
.br
Enable gngeo's internal debugger, for hacking, cheating, or fixing bugs.
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-effect=STRING
.br
Use the specified video effect. \fB-e help\fP will provide a list of available
effects.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fullscreen
.br
Start gngeo in fullscreen mode.
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-hwsurface
.br
Use a SDL hardware surface for the emulator's video.  This can improve
performance if your video hardware/drivers are fast.
.TP
.B \-I, \-\-interpolation
.br
Enable interpolation from one frame to the next.  This can make the display
look "smoother", but has a performance penalty.
.TP
.B \-\-joystick
.br
Enable joystick support.
.TP
.B \-\-libglpath=[path]
.br
Use STRING as libGL (default should normally be okay).
.TP
.B     \-\-msg1=<xpos>:<ypos>:msg
.br
User message 1. See 'USER MESSAGES' below.
.TP
.B     \-\-msg2=<xpos>:<ypos>:msg
.br
User message 2. See 'USER MESSAGES' below.
.TP
.B     \-\-msg3=<xpos>:<ypos>:msg
.br
User message 3. See 'USER MESSAGES' below.
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-pal
.br
Use PAL timings.  This currently has bugs.
.TP
.B \-\-p1control=ARRAY
.TP
.B \-\-p2control=ARRAY
.TP
.br
Player 1 and Player 2 keyboard and joystick mappings.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-raster
.br
Enable the raster interrupt. (need more details)
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-rompath=[path]
.br
Give the path to locate the ROM collection.  The default is to look
in /usr/share/gngeo, but your ROM collection is most likely not there. :)
.TP
.B \-\-sound
.br
Enable sound emulation.
.TP
.B \-\-showfps
.br
When the emulator is started, show a frames-per-second count.  This can be
used to gauge a baseline performance for the emulation.
.TP
.B \-\-sleepidle
.br
Enabling this option will cause the emulator to give up time to the system
when it is idle.  It can incur a performance penalty, but can also make the
emulator "nicer" to the rest of the system.
.TP
.B \-\-system=STRING
.br
This option allows you to set the type of the emulated system to \fBhome\fP or \fBarcade\fP,
depending on how you prefer to play your games.  There are some differences in many games
if they detect a home system instead or an arcade system.
.TP
.B \-\-scale=N
.br
Upscale the resolution by N.  For example, if N is 3, the Neo-Geo output, which is normally
320x224, will become 960x448.  You may encounter a mode which is not hardware accelerated
when using this option.
.TP
.B \-\-samplerate=N
.br
Set the sound sample rate to N.  N will typically be 11025, 22050, 32000, or 44100.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-transpack=STRING
.br
Use the specified transparency pack (need more details)
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
.br
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
.br
Show program version
.SH SCREEN MESSAGES
.PP
the msg1, msg2 and msg3 options allow the specification of up to three messages
to be displayed on the screen. This has the format:
.PP
x\-pos:y\-pos:msg
.PP
where x\-pos and y\-pos are numeric x and y positions for the message. Negative values of x\-pos and y\-pos will result in the message being positioned relative to the maximum x or y position (so back from the right edge or up from the bottom).
.PP
msg is the message itself. This can contain the string '\n' to represent a newline, or format strings in the form:
.PP
%h \- hostname
.br
%g \- game/rom name
.br
%s \- system type of rom
.br
%c \- country/region for rom
.br
%H \- hour
.br
%M \- minute
.br
%S \- seconds
.br
%d \- day
.br
%m \- month
.br
%y \- 2-digit year
.br
%Y-\` 4-digit year
.PP
messages can also be broken up into 'submessages', by being seperated with the
pipe character '|'. These sub-messages can then be cycled through using the F7 key.
.PP
This feature is intended to allow a 'crib' of moves to be displayed onscreen, esp. for fighting games that tend to have a lot of 'hcf\-a,d,d,d' special moves. As fighting games have multiple characters, one can define submessages and cycle through to the messages appropriate for a given character. So, for instance the line below
.TP
Msg1=JURI gb:<\-B ls:f,fd,d+ABC rs:d,fd,f+ABC sk:d,db,b+ABC|ROOMI sp:j,d+C rb:d,fd,f+ABC rc:b,f+ABC rB:j+ABC|GUNTER: BS:C gb:f,d,df+ABC ws:360+ABC hb:360+A+B+C|%g\-%s\-%c %H:%M:%S|
.PP
Contains some moves for three characters from 'Galaxy Fight' and a status display as the last selection

.SH HARDWARE
The SNK Neo-Geo system was cartridge-based and was sold to arcades as well as
homes.  It has a 68000 CPU, a Z80 for sound, and custom graphics hardware, and
its main claim to fame was that it has the highest megabit count of any
cartridge-based system in history, allowing for detailed animation and huge
sprites.
.PP
MVS, the arcade system, had mainboards which could accept up to six cartridges
at once.  The user could choose one of the games to play by simply moving the
joystick.  This allowed arcade operators to maximize the choice of games
available to players without taking up floor space with more dedicated
cabinets.
.PP
AES, the "Advanced Entertainment System", was the home Neo-Geo system.  It
sold for hundreds of dollars at launch and the cartridges generally cost around
$200 a piece.  However, there was no truer way for players to have the "arcade
at home" experience in 1990.  The joysticks were authentic arcade joysticks
and the cartridges were huge.  The cartridges, while shaped differently, had
the exact same data stored in them as the MVS arcade cartridges.  Some
companies sold adapters to use MVS cartridges (which typically could be found
cheaply on the used market) on the AES console.
.PP
The Neo-Geo introduced the idea of a memory card, which could be shared
between the MVS and AES systems (as the hardware was essentially identical).
The user could take his/her high scores and other saved data between the
arcade and home.
.PP
Some later cartridges used some hardware bootleg protection that had to be
first understood and then worked around.  New software is still released even today
for the MVS and AES systems, though SNK itself finally went bankrupt in 2001.
.SH NOTES
gngeo is fast, but still has some bugs.  Visit the homepage at:

if you would like to help development or submit bug reports.
.PP
Some planned features are netplay support, better game compatibility, and better
portability, as well as more i386-specific optimizations.
